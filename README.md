# Thermodynamics of the Ising model encoded in restricted Boltzmann machines

Jing Gu and Kai Zhang, Duke Kunshan University, 2022

## Abstract
This repo contains sample codes for the RBM which can be trained to learn the Boltzmann distribution of Ising configurations. The input should consist of binary units of {-1, +1}.
